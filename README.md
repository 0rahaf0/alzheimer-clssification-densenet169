Alzheimer's Classification Using DenseNet169

This project classifies Alzheimer's disease using MRI images and the DenseNet169 deep learning architecture. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, primarily using TensorFlow and Keras.

Project Structure

-Mount Google Drive: For accessing data in Google Colab.
-Import Libraries: Essential libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
-Data Preparation: Loading, preprocessing, and augmenting MRI images.
-Model Building: Creating the DenseNet169-based CNN model.
-Training: Configuring the training process with early stopping and model checkpointing.
-Evaluation: Evaluating the model on validation data.
-Visualization: Plotting training and validation accuracy and loss.

Data
Ensure MRI image data is available and correctly referenced in the notebook.

Model
The model is built using the DenseNet169 architecture from TensorFlow/Keras.

Results
Training and validation metrics are visualized to evaluate model performance.
